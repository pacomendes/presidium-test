# public final enum ChronoField


A standard set of fields.
 <p>
 This set of fields provide field-based access to manipulate a date, time or date-time.
 The standard set of fields can be extended by implementing {@link TemporalField}.
 <p>
 These fields are intended to be applicable in multiple calendar systems.
 For example, most non-ISO calendar systems define dates as a year, month and day,
 just with slightly different rules.
 The documentation of each field explains how it operates.
