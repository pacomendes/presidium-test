# public final enum DayOfWeek


A day-of-week, such as 'Tuesday'.
 <p>
 {@code DayOfWeek} is an enum representing the 7 days of the week -
 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
 <p>
 In addition to the textual enum name, each day-of-week has an {@code int} value.
 The {@code int} value follows the ISO-8601 standard, from 1 (Monday) to 7 (Sunday).
 It is recommended that applications use the enum rather than the {@code int} value
 to ensure code clarity.
 <p>
 This enum provides access to the localized textual form of the day-of-week.
 Some locales also assign different numeric values to the days, declaring
 Sunday to have the value 1, however this class provides no support for this.
 See {@link WeekFields} for localized week-numbering.
 <p>
 <b>Do not use {@code ordinal()} to obtain the numeric representation of {@code DayOfWeek}.
 Use {@code getValue()} instead.</b>
 <p>
 This enum represents a common concept that is found in many calendar systems.
 As such, this enum may be used by any calendar system that has the day-of-week
 concept defined exactly equivalent to the ISO calendar system.
