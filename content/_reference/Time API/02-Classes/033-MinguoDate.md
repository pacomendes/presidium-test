# public final class MinguoDate


A date in the Minguo calendar system.
 <p>
 This date operates using the {@linkplain MinguoChronology Minguo calendar}.
 This calendar system is primarily used in the Republic of China, often known as Taiwan.
 Dates are aligned such that {@code 0001-01-01 (Minguo)} is {@code 1912-01-01 (ISO)}.

 <p>
 This is a <a href="{@docRoot}/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>
 class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
 ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of
 {@code MinguoDate} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
 The {@code equals} method should be used for comparisons.
