# public static final enum ZoneOffsetTransitionRule.TimeDefinition


A definition of the way a local time can be converted to the actual
 transition date-time.
 <p>
 Time zone rules are expressed in one of three ways:
 <ul>
 <li>Relative to UTC</li>
 <li>Relative to the standard offset in force</li>
 <li>Relative to the wall offset (what you would see on a clock on the wall)</li>
 </ul>
